# Working Railcar Weight Station
Arduino code for the Thingiverse 3D print by ajkochev.

This is the code for a working model railroad weight scale station.  My 3D parts are for N scale but the code here can be used for any scale with some modification.

Project parts list, 3D parts and more info can be found here on Thingiverse.
